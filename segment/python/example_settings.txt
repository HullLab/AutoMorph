# output:
# The full path where we should save the results - a subdirectory will be
# created in this directory based on original directory name and selected mode:
output = /home/kln26/hull/segment_testing

# threshold:
# The B/W image thresholding value used to segment images- best values tend to
# be 0.15-0.40 for Hull Lab images. For new projects, try multiple possible
# values with : threshold = 0.15 - 0.40 by 0.1
# for sample, you can select a range as threshold = 0.15 - 0.40 by 0.1
# for final mode, only give a single threshold value as threshold = 0.16
threshold = 0.16

#minimumSize:
# The smallest width of a valid object in microns (or other base unit). The
# minimum size is designed to filter out background light scatter. You
# can, again, use multiple sizes and this will run the segmentation process
# multiple times, one with each combination of values:
minimumSize = 100.0

# maximumSize:
# Same as minimumSize, but for the maximum width of a valid object. The
# maximum size is designed to ignore the white rim of some slides or other
# large-scale noise.  maximimSize is also given in the pixel
# base unit:
maximumSize = 2000.0

# mode:
# tells what method we want to use:
#  'sample' - save five objects per settings/directories; used to identify
#           best parameters
#  'final' - full save of all objects segmented with the best parameters

# Set a level for debug output - off, low or high:

# size of x and y pixels, comment out or remove if reading from xml file
# set to # of units (see below) per pixel
