% MESHES3D 3D Surface Meshes
% Version 1.0 21-Mar-2011 .
%
%   Creation, vizualization, and manipulation of 3D surface meshes or
%   polyhedra.
%
%   Meshes and Polyhedra are represented by a couple of variables {V, F}:
%   V: Nv-by-3 array of vertices: [x1 y1 z1; ... ; xn yn zn];
%   F: is either a NF-by-3 or NF-by-4 array containing reference for
%   vertices of each face, or a NF-by-1 cell array, where each cell is an
%   array containing a variable number of node indices.
%   For some functions, the array E of edges is needed. It consists in a
%   NE-by-2 array containing indices of source and target vertices. 
%
%   The library provides function to create basic polyhedric meshes (the
%   five platonic solids, plus few others), as well as functions to perform
%   basic computations (surface area, normal angles, face centroids...).
%   The 'MengerSponge' structure is an example of mesh that is not simply
%   connected (multiple tunnels in the structure).
%
%   The drawMesh function is mainly a wrapper to the Matlab 'patch'
%   function, allowing passing arguments more quickly.
%
%   Example
%     % create a soccer ball mesh and display it
%     [v e f] = createSoccerBall;
%     drawMesh(v, f, 'faceColor', 'g', 'linewidth', 2);
%     axis equal; view(3);
