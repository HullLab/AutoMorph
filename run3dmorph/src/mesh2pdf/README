This set of functions provides a way to embed 3D meshes in a PDF.

Input: mesh defined by points and triangles (and eventually colors defined over the vertices or over the triaangles)

Output: a simple tex file that can be included a  Latex file

How is works:

mesh        => idtf file : with matlab
idtf file   => u3d file  : with the U3D converter

and generate a Latex template.

This software uses:

- verbatim.m : written by Douglas M. Schwarz
- the U3D tools from : http://sourceforge.net/projects/u3d/
and the nicely repackaged version from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mathgl/files/
by Michail Vidiassov

On Windows you need to install:

- MikTex 2.8 (to convert TeX + U3D files to a PDF)
