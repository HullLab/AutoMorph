These are VERY basic install instructions -- a more streamlined process
with fewer required edits will be available soon.  In short, this was
proof-of-concept code, with a 'real' application coming soon.

(Note also that you need a copy of the Zerene Stacker software to use
these programs.)

# Part 0: Changes common to all three programs:

(A) Edit the 'rc' files (bashrc / cshrc, depending on shell)

		There are lines that look like (bashrc version):

		export PATH=${PATH}:/software/segment/bin
		export PATH=${PATH}:/software/focus/bin
		export PATH=${PATH}:/software/run2dmorph/bin

		Fix the '/software' bit so that it uses the path you've copied these files into (eg, '/home/me/automorph')



# Part 1: Changes to 'segment':

		There's a line in 'segment/bin/segment' which reads:

		matlab -nodisplay -nodesktop -nosplash -r "addpath('/hull-disk1/ph269/software/segment/current'); segment('$SETTINGSFILE'); exit"

		Change the path in the 'addpath' section to reflect the location of the software on your system


# Part 2: Changes to 'focus':

		There's a line in 'focus/bin/focus' which reads:

		xvfb-run /hull-disk1/ph269/software/ZereneStacker/v1.04/ZereneStacker $BATCHXML > ${TARGETDIR}/zerene.log

		Change this path to reflect the location of the Zerene Stacker software (and it's executable script) on your system.

# Part 3: Changes to 'run2dmorph':

		Alison will add this at some point soon.  :)
