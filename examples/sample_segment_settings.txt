# These are example settings for the image segment code ('isegment', for now)
# Comments (lines starting with a '#') and blank lines are ignored, everything

# directory:
# The full path of the scans we want to process - currently does not descend 
# into subdirectories, but we'll fix that shortly:
directory = /CH-82-21_0-1cm_g150_PG_43.288lat_-29.83long_2103m/CH-82-21_0-1cm_g150_PG_43.288lat_-29.83long_2103m_1_compound_umbilical_1_zstackEDF-0_5x

# output:
# The full path where we should save the results - a subdirectory will be
# created in this directory based on the tag name, threshold value and min/max
# object sizes:
output = /segmented

# threshold:
# The B/W image thresholding value - so far, it seems somewhere around
# 0.20-0.40 is best, but it may require tweaking.  You can use multiple values
# in the form of 'threshold = 0.20 - 0.30 by 0.05', for example.
#threshold = 0.20 - 0.25 by 0.05
threshold = 0.20

# minimumSize:
# The smallest width of a valid object we want to filter for, in microns - you
# can, again, use multiple sizes and this will run the segmentation process
# multiple times, one with each combination of values:
minimumSize = 100

# maximumSize:
# Same as minimumSize, but for the maximum width of a valid object, in
# microns:
maximumSize = 2000

# mode:
# Tells what method we want to use:
#  'statistics' - show number of objects
#  'sample' - save five objects per settings/directories
#  'save' - full save of all objects
mode = save

# debug:
# Set a level for debug output - off, low or high:
debug = low

# tag:
# A unique ID to 'tag' each output directory with (optional):
tag = trial

# 'Source' tag:
source = Coretop

# 'Age' tag:
age = Recent
